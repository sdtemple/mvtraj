Shape-based Clustering of Multivariate Longitudinal Data

We extend shape-based clustering for longitudinal data to the novel application of microbiome taxa composition with zero inflation. We find interesting longitudinal profiles for some clusters of subjects.

Most of the analysis is done in Python; some summary and EDA is done in R. Below is a description of some files:

  mvtrajectories.py : our methods
  
  mb-trajectories.ipynb : k-means
  
  xxxx.ipynb : a simulation study
  
  xxxx.R : some bootstrapping to study significance
