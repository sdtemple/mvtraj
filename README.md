Shape-based Clustering of Multivariate Longitudinal Data

We extend shape-based clustering for longitudinal data (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150738) to the novel application of microbiome taxa composition with zero inflation. We find interesting longitudinal profiles for some clusters of subjects.

Most of the analysis is done in Python; some summary and EDA is done in R. Below is a description of some files:

  mvtrajectories.py : our methods
  
  mb-trajectories.ipynb : k-means
  
  xxxx.ipynb : a simulation study
  
  xxxx.R : some bootstrapping to study significance
  
This is a course project. TPython functions may error out for unexpected input types.
